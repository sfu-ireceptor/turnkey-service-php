# iReceptor Turnkey

The iReceptor Turnkey is a quick and easy mechanism for researchers to create their own [AIRR Data Commons](https://docs.airr-community.org/en/latest/api/adc.html#datacommons) repository.

Version | Branch | Status | Last update 
--- | --- | --- | ---
**4.0** | [production-v4](https://github.com/sfu-ireceptor/turnkey-service-php/tree/production-v4) | **Recommended.** | Sep 9, 2022 -> [Release Notes](CHANGELOG.md)
3.1 | [production-v3](https://github.com/sfu-ireceptor/turnkey-service-php/tree/production-v3) | Still maintained. | May 10, 2021 -> [Release Notes](https://github.com/sfu-ireceptor/turnkey-service-php/blob/production-v3/CHANGELOG.md) 


## What's in the iReceptor Turnkey?
- a database
- scripts to add data to the database
- a web service exposing the database via the [ADC API](https://docs.airr-community.org/en/latest/api/adc_api.html)

These components are packaged as Docker images. The installation script will:
- install Docker
- download and run these Docker images

[Read more about the iReceptor Turnkey](http://www.ireceptor.org/repositories#turnkey) on the iReceptor website. The remainder of this document only provides installation instructions.

## System requirements

- Linux Ubuntu. The turnkey was tested on Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, and 20.04.
- `sudo` without password. It's usually the default on virtual machines.

## Installation

Download the `production-v4` code:

```
git clone --branch production-v4 https://github.com/sfu-ireceptor/turnkey-service-php.git
```

Launch the installation script. Note: multiple Docker images will be downloaded from DockerHub. Installation time estimate: 10-30 min.

```
cd turnkey-service-php
scripts/install_turnkey.sh
```

## Check it's working

```
curl -k --data "{}" "https://localhost/airr/v1/repertoire"
```

This returns the list of repertoires in your database, by querying the web service at `/airr/v1/repertoire`, an [ADC API](https://docs.airr-community.org/en/latest/api/adc_api.html) entry point.


You can also visit <https://localhost> in your browser (replace "localhost" with your server URL if necessary). You'll see the home page for your repository, with information about the ADC API and iReceptor. Note: a self-signed SSL certificate is used by default, so you might see a security warning. But you can [install your own SSL certificate](doc/installing_a_custom_ssl_certificate.md). If you don't want to the turnkey to use HTTPS, you can easily [disable HTTPS](doc/disabling_https.md).


## Loading data
The general data loading procedure, for a study which has generated sequence data is to:
1. load the associated repertoire metadata using the [iReceptor Metadata CSV format](https://github.com/sfu-ireceptor/dataloading-curation/tree/master/metadata). Note: it's also possible to use the [AIRR Repertoire Schema JSON format](https://docs.airr-community.org/en/latest/datarep/metadata.html).

2. load the sequence annotations (rearrangements) from IMGT, MiXCR, etc.

## Loading the test data
Load the included test data to familiarize yourself with the data loading procedure. You will delete that test data afterwards.

Note: the test data is a single repertoire with 1000 rearrangements. It's a subset from the study [The Different T-cell Receptor Repertoires in Breast Cancer Tumors, Draining Lymph Nodes, and Adjacent Tissues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28039161) data.

1. **Load the repertoire metadata file** [test_data/PRJNA330606_Wang_1_sample_metadata.csv](test_data/PRJNA330606_Wang_1_sample_metadata.csv).
```
scripts/load_metadata.sh ireceptor test_data/PRJNA330606_Wang_1_sample_metadata.csv
```

Check it worked:
```
curl -k --data "{}" "https://localhost/airr/v1/repertoire"
```
The repertoire metadata is returned as JSON.

2. **Load the rearrangements file** [test_data/SRR4084215_aa_mixcr_annotation_1000_lines.txt](test_data/SRR4084215_aa_mixcr_annotation_1000_lines.txt):
```
scripts/load_rearrangements.sh mixcr test_data/SRR4084215_aa_mixcr_annotation_1000_lines.txt
```

Check it worked:
```
curl -k --data "{}" "https://localhost/airr/v1/rearrangement"
```
All of the rearrangement data for the 1000 sequences is returned as JSON.

3. **Verify the data was loaded correctly**:
```
scripts/verify_dataload.sh PRJNA330606 test_data PRJNA330606_Wang_1_sample_metadata.csv mixcr /tmp
```
The above command verifies the provenance of the data loaded with the previous commands (`load_metadata.sh`, `load_rearrangements.sh`), assuming that data is loaded a study at a time as described above. The `verify_dataload.sh` command takes as parameters the Study ID (`PRJNA330606`) of the study to test, the directory in which the study metadata and the rearrangement data is stored (`test_data`), the study metadata file within this directory (`PRJNA330606_Wang_1_sample_metadata.csv`), the file format for the rearrangement files (`mixcr` in this case, but should be one of `mixcr`, `vquest`, or `airr`), and a directory (`/tmp`) in which to generate the data provenance report.  

This will output a summary report checking the data that was loaded into the repository against the data that is returned by querying the AIRR Data Commons API and retrieving that data. The report compares all of information in the metadata file against what is returned from the ADC API to confirm the data was loaded and is returned correctly. In addition, the process compares the number of rearrangements in the rearrangement files against the count returned by the the ADC API as well as the ir_curator_count field in the metadata file (should that column exist). 

This process should report no errors. If so, the data was loaded and retrieved correctly. Note that this process has a number of restrictions:
- it works with data that is loaded as iReceptor metadata files only (AIRR Repertoire files are not supported)
- it requires the metadata file and the rearrangements be in the same directory
- it requires that the repertoire_id field in the iReceptor metadata file be populated for verification
- it expects that the ir_curator_count field in the iReceptor metadata file be populated with the count of the number of lines in the repertoire
- it expects a set of file extensions to be associated with each file type (`mixcr` and .txt files, `vquest` and txz files, and `airr` either fmt19 or tsv files).

For more information on using the `verify_dataload.sh` script and how to interpret the results of the report please refer to the [Verify Dataloading documentation](doc/sanitychecking.md). 

Note: all of the scripts `load_metadata.sh`, `load_rearrangement.sh`, and `verify_dataload.sh` produce a log file for each file processed in the `log` directory. Log files are named using the current date, followed by the name of the processed file.

That's all, congratulations :relaxed: You can now [reset the turnkey database](doc/resetting.md) and load your own data.

## Loading your own data

Note: use a clearly defined curation process for your data to ensure good provenance. Refer to the [iReceptor Curation](http://www.ireceptor.org/curation) process and the [iReceptor Curation GitHub repository](https://github.com/sfu-ireceptor/dataloading-curation/tree/master) for recommended data curation approaches.

To load your own data, follow the same procedure as with the test data.
Note: make sure your rearrangement/clone/cell/expression files are declared in the repertoire metadata file for the appropriate repertoires,
under the `data_processing_files` column.

### Load your repertoire metadata:
```
scripts/load_metadata.sh ireceptor <file path of your CSV or JSON metadata file>
```
### Load your rearrangement files.
The following command will load all AIRR Rearrangement TSV files ending with `.tsv` from <your study data folder>.
```
scripts/load_rearrangements.sh airr <your study data folder>/*.tsv
```
Compressed `.gz` files are supported and can be loaded directly. Example:
```
scripts/load_rearrangements.sh airr <your study data folder>/*.gz
```
Note: make sure that the full file name, including the `.gz` extension, was declared in the repertoire metadata file.

Simply type the loading command to get a help message to determine which rearrangement file types are supported by
the data loader (e.g. `airr`, `mixcr`, `mixcr_v3`, or `imgt`)

### Load your clone files

The following command will load all AIRR Clone JSON files ending with `.json` from <your study data folder>.
```
scripts/load_clones.sh airr-clone <your study data folder>/*.json
```
Again, compressed files are allowed, but the full compressed file name must be listed for the repertoire in the metadata file.

### Load your cell files

The following command will load all AIRR Cell JSON files ending with `.json` from <your study data folder>.
```
scripts/load_cells.sh airr-cell <your study data folder>/*.json
```
Again, compressed files are allowed, but the full compressed file name must be listed for the repertoire in the metadata file.
  
### Load your gene expression files

The following command will load all AIRR Expression JSON files ending with `.json` from <your study data folder>.
```
scripts/load_expression.sh airr-expression <your study data folder>/*.json
```
Again, compressed files are allowed, but the full compressed file name must be listed for the repertoire in the metadata file.
 
### Loading large rearrangement/clone/cell/expression data files.
:warning: Loading many rearrangements, clones, cells, or expression data can take hours. We recommend using the Unix command `nohup` to run the script in the background, and to redirect the script output to a log file. So you can log out and come back later to check on the data loading progress by looking at that file. Example:

```
nohup scripts/load_rearrangements.sh mixcr my_study_folder/*.txt > progress.log &
```
### Updating repertoire metadata

Invairably you will need to make a change to the repertoire metadata that you loaded.
There is a simple update_metadata script to perform this for you. As with loading the metadata
you simply tell the script what type of repertoire metadata you are loading (ireceptor or AIRR Repertoire JSON)
and the file. Because this is updating the repository live, there is an option to run the entire script and report
on any updates that the script would perform *without* actually loading any data (--skipload). 

If you edit the test metadata file, and then run:

```
scripts/update_metadata.sh ireceptor --skipload test_data/PRJNA330606_Wang_1_sample_metadata.csv
```
This will  report that it is changing the fields for the repertoire, but it will *not* write those changes to the 
repository. If you are comfortable with the changes it reports then you can rerun the script without the --skipload 
option to make the changes.

:warning: This command will update the database. Before making changes to the repository, you should consider making 
a backup of the database.

```
scripts/update_metadata.sh ireceptor test_data/PRJNA330606_Wang_1_sample_metadata.csv
```


## Backing up the database
When you've loaded your data, we recommend [backing up the database](doc/database_backup.md) to avoid having to load your data again in case a problem happens.

## Adding sequence statistics

The iReceptor repositories support a set of sequence level statistics such as gene usage and CDR3 length. These statistics are
pre-computed at the repertoire level for rearrangements. They can be accessed using the
[iReceptor Plus Stats API](https://github.com/ireceptor-plus/specifications/blob/master/stats-api.yaml) extension to the 
AIRR Data Commons API. The iReceptor Gateway will make use of these stats if your repository supports them.

To load the stats for a study, simply use the load_stats.sh command as follows:
```
scripts/load_stats.sh PRJNA330606
```
This will generate and load statistics for the study with Study ID `PRJNA330606`

If you update the rearrangements for a study, it will be necessary to remove and reload the statistics for that study. You can do this easily as follows:
```
scripts/remove_stats.sh PRJNA330606
scripts/load_stats.sh PRJNA330606
```
Note that removing statistics is a non-recoverable process. As with any operation that deletes data from a repository, it is a good idea to [back up your
repository](doc/database_backup.md) before this step.
