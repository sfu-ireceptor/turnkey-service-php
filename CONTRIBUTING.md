## How to contribute to iReceptor

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/sfu-ireceptor/dataloading-mongo/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/sfu-ireceptor/dataloading-mongo/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* The iReceptor team uses Jira to manage the coordination of internal development. Once your issue is being addressed by the team, it will be assigned a Jira issue ID of the form IR-NNNN and patches and discussion will use that ID.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the iReceptor platform will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use the iReceptor project by using mailto:support@ireceptor.org.

#### **Please join us!**

Thanks!
