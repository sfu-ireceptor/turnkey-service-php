# Upgrading your repository data for the AIRR v1.4 specification

As of September 2022 the AIRR Community released the [AIRR v1.4 specification](https://www.antibodysociety.org/airr-community/airr-community-standards-v1-4-now-available/) (see the [release notes](https://docs.airr-community.org/en/stable/news.html)). iReceptor v4.0 supports this new specification, but some data updates in your repository are required. These updates are about making the data more precise, the key change being the conversion of `string` fields to combined `numerical` + unit `ontology` fields. We have provided scripts that will attempt to automatically update the data in your repository.

# What will change

The main fields impacted by these changes are:
- `keywords_study`: this field is a controlled vocabulary. Some vocabulary terms have changed and new terms have been added. The full set of controlled vocabulary terms is: `contains_ig, contains_tr, contains_paired_chain, contains_schema_rearrangement, contains_schema_clone, contains_schema_cell, contains_schema_receptor`
- `collection_time_point_relative`: this field was orginally a string that had a time point that was relative to a `collection_time_point_event`. For example you might have a `collection_time_point_event` of "Symptom Onset" and a `collection_time_point_relative` for a sample that was taken on "Day 4". This makes it very difficult to compare time courses across studies in the AIRR Data Commons, since the numerical value and units are combined in a single string. The 1.4 specification has changed this field to be a numerical value "4" and a label and ID from the [Unit Ontology (UO)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/search?q=year&ontology=uo) in the form of `collection_time_point_relative_unit.id:"UO:0000036"` and `collection_time_point_relative_unit.label;"year"`
- `template_amount`: this field used to be a string that provided a measurement for the amount of template material used in a sample. As above, strings are ill-suited for storing measurements, and this field has  been split into two fields, a numeric `template_amount` (e.g. `template_amount:10`) and a unit ontology label and ID (e.g. `template_amount_unit.id: UO:0000024`, `template_amount_unit.label: "nanogram"`).
- Dates: Although date fields were formally not AIRR fields, the AIRR specification has added time and date fields for noting when records were created and updated. The iReceptor Turnkey has always maintained such records, but these internal records now need to be converted to ISO standard dates. 

# Updating the data

:warning: Your repository data will change. Before running the scripts below, we recommend making 
a [backup of the database](database_backup.md).

To update the data in your repository, you can use the following scripts:

```
scripts/update_keywords_study.sh keywords_study single_cell ir_sequence_count
```
- This will update the `keywords_study` field to ensure that it has correct values. It usese the `single_cell` field and the internal `ir_sequence_count` field to help populate the correct keywords.
- Errors: If the script can not convert a field in a repertoire, a message will be printed such as: `For sample id 6079e75720652127e63515ab could not identify keyword has_paired_chain`. In this case, the script expects a keyword `contains_paired_chain` and the repository has an unknown keyword `has_paired_chain`. This implies that data was originally loaded with an invalid keyword `has_paired_chain`.

```
scripts/update_collection_time_point_relative.sh collection_time_point_relative
```
- This updates the `collection_time_point_relative` field, converting the string field to a numerical value and an ontology base unit field.
- Errors: If the script can not convert a field in a repertoire, a message will be printed such as: `For sample id 635af0c93891ed552fe4dd21 could not find the collection time point relative I could process 0.0`. In this case, the value is already a numerical value and therefore no conversion can take place.  

```
scripts/update_template_amount.sh template_amount
```
- This updates the `template_amount` field, converting the string field to a numerical value and an ontology base unit field.
- Errors: If the script can not convert a field in a repertoire, a message will be printed such as `For sample _id 609c04b40eb3bf2735751a1d could not find the template amount I could process 250â€“500 ng`. In this case the conversion could not be done because the amount is a range.

```
scripts/update_dates.sh sample '%a %b %d %Y %H:%M:%S %Z'
```
- This updates the internal iReceptor `ir_created_at` and `ir_updated_at` fields of the `sample` (repertoire) collection in the database, changing the string dates from a human readable format to the AIRR Standard compliant ISO date format. The format string above describes the data format that the iReceptor v3.0 data loader initially used in the repository when data was loaded. You can also run this script on the `rearrangement` collection, but these dates are internal dates only so although recommended for consistency this is not absolutely necessary. Running this on the `rearrangement` collection will take a long time (it is updating millions of records).
- Errors: If the script can not update the date (e.g. the original date is not in the format specified) then a notification for each record will be output (for sample data only).

```
scripts/update_adc_date_fields.sh update
```
- This will update the AIRR Data Commons date fields `adc_update_date` and `adc_publish_date` to take on the current internal date/time fields as stored in the database. 

# Checking it worked

Make sure no more updates are required by running `scripts/update_turnkey.sh` and check that the warning message does not appear anymore.

# What to do if something went wrong

Each of the update scripts above will report if it could not change a field. There are several reasons this might happen:

- You have previously run the script on your repository and fields have already been updated. For example, if you have already run `update_adc_update.sh` the correct date will be already in the repository, and the conversion will not recognize the date field because it is not in the old format.
- A field can not be converted. For both `update_collection_time_point_relative.sh` and `update_template_amount.sh` the conversion attempts to change fields like `4 years` to an integer field `4` and an ontology time field represented by `year, UO:0000036`. If the conversion cannot deduce either the value or the unit, the script will inform you and tell for which repertoire record the problem ocurred. In each case, the original data in the repository will be stored in a field with the same name with an `ir_` as a name prefix. This ensures that no data is lost.

In each case where an error is reported, the data curator should assess what the problem is and determine how to fix the problem. For example, if the field contains a typo of word "day" in the field (`4 dys`), this will not be converted because "dys" is not a recognized time unit. In this case the curator should fix this problem using the [update metadata](../README.md#updating-repertoire-metadata) process on a repertoire by repertoire basis.
